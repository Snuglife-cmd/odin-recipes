    <h2>Ready in 5 minutes Carbonara</h2>
    <p>Aaaa this takes me back to when I was but a young lad living in in 
        rural Bourges. The smell of wine in the air as my mother danced 
        in front of the fire, the flittering laughter of my young siblings, 
        Hanzel & Gretel as they played hide and seek. Hanzel was such the 
        explorer while Gretel was always the follower. I remember one time 
        long ago they got lost in the woods outside vichy................</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Linguini 500g</li>
        <li>Bacon 500g</li>
        <li>Cream 300ml</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese 250g (Grated)</li>

        <li>Bring a pot of water to the boil and add your Linguini. You're looking to cook this for roughly 8 minutes or until aldente.</li>
        <li>While the linguini is boiling bring a pan to high heat. Add just enough oil to coat the base and add your bacon.</li>
        <li>Cook the bacon until crispy, while keeping an eye on the pasta. This is a good time grate your parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Once the bacon is cooked to your liking. Add your cream to the pan. Once the cream starts to boil swap the pan to a low heat and let it simmer.</li>
        <li>Your linguini should be done around this point, so make sure to drain about 90% of the water from it and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Once your cream and bacon has thickened enough add your linquini and the linguini water to the mix and stir.</li>
        <li>Once combined add in your parmesan cheese, along with a couple squeezes of lemon and stir again.</li>
        <li>Plate the food and sprinkle some parmesan over the top if thats what you're into.</li>
